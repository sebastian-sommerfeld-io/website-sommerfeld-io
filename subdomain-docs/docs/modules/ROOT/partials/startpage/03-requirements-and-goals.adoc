== Requirements Overview
* Publish docs for my projects on a documentation website with dedicated spaces for each project. Utilize my existing Asciidoc documentation.
* Use Git as Version Control System
* Don't add a blog section since this probably would outdate rather soon. Write HowTo / tutorial pages instead of blog posts.

== Quality Goals
* Update the website automatically (scheduled or via push trigger)
